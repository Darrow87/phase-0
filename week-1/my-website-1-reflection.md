Describe what open source means.

You can see the code as well as the result of the code. Others can edit the project or use your code as well.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think it's a cool aspect of the programming community. It seems to really benefit those starting off, not so much the more advanced programmers. Once I am advanced I will try to remember how it helped me, and be as generous.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licensing is important to protect yourself legally.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I am getting better uploading from git and using the commands. I am confused about branching within git, I understand it within github I think.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I don't remember the site but I googled stuff periodically to complete assignments as oppposed to looking back through the DB material.
