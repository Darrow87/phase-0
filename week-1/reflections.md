1.1 Think About Time

I learned about time boxing and creating tiny habits.

Time boxing is sectioning off specified periods of time to work towards a certain goal. Importantly, you must cease work and reflect upon what was accomplished when the time period is up.

I don't really have a specific strategy currently to manage time. I tend to have short term obsessions that I fuel with red bull. When I lose interest I move onto the next thing.

My "time management technique" works to a certain extent. I do make progress on whatever my current goal is, but it comes at the neglect of everything else in my life I would say. Also, I tend to put aside whatever I have been working on after a certain period of time.

I wil try to employ tiny habits. I like the idea of doing something very easy, because I tend to have very low motivation for things. Perhaps if I can put myself into a situation where I do something more frequently, it will be easier to increase it over time.

My overall plan is to work on assignments each day for a couple of hours. Hopefully I will find time to do them at work too, but this doesn't seem likely since I need to have all this Ruby stuff set up on my computer! Darn :(.

1.2 The Command Line

What is a shell? What is "bash?"
A shell is basically the command line. Bash is a methodology of interacting with the command line, i.e. it has specific commands associated with it, whereas the commands would be different if using something other than Bash.

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

From the examples it wasn't immediately apparent to me how the commands worked, I had to play with it myself to figure it out. Also some of the commands didn't work how I thought they should. Like cd, you can only move up or down one directory if you just type in the name of the directory, I would try to jump several using just it's name and it wouldn't work.

3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands

Most of them, some of them I still do not completely understand. But I went through the exercises.

4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

Maybe the help one so you can figure out how to do different things. Also grep, cd and pwd. Grep because it allows you to search for things, cd b/c you have to be able to move through the folders, and pwd because without a GUI you could never see where you are, so this one is necessary to keep checking.

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd prints your current pathway

-ls lists the items of the folder you are in

-mv moves a file from one folder to the next

-cd changes your directory

-../ moves you up in a directory, more than one directory if you include it multiple times

-touch allows you to create a file

-mkdir creates a new directory

-less allows you to view the contents of a file

-rmdir removes a directory

-rm removes a file

-help gives you help on a certain command that you don't know


1.4 Forking and Cloning

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
Instructions would be:

Create repository 1) Go to your github profile; 2) click the + in the upper right and select new repository.

Fork repo: 1) navigate to the repo you want to fork and select the fork repo button; 2) select your github profile from the options

Clone repo: 1) access the repo you have cloned from your github profile and copy the link on the right side of the page; 2) using the command line, go to the directory where you want to deposit this information and type 'git clone' and copy the link. 3) hit enter

You would create a fork so that you could do some work and then merge this fork into the original project, which is the point of version control. We don't need to have new projects for each change we make, we have forks that where we do work and then merge them back into the bigger project.

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I didn't really have struggles since dev bootcamp provided instructions for how to do it. I learned that there is actually some use for using the command line since this is how we will interact with git.

I am still confused as to how these directories I create through the command line interact with the interface of my computer. For example, I created a phase-0-curriculum directory to deposit my fork into, but I can't seem to find that now as a folder anywhere on my computer. But I thought a directory was just supposed to be a folder.
