# Pseudocode
# create a loop that will run fib sequence
# stop loop when it is greater than or equal to num
# return true if equal to num, false if greater than


# Initial Solution

def is_fibonacci?(num)
sum = 0
sum_fib = 1
  until sum_fib >= num
    sum_fib = sum_fib + sum
    sum = sum_fib - sum
  end

  if sum_fib == num
    return true
  else
    return false
  end

end
