      The benefits of version control are that they allow one person or several people to work on a project without interfering with one another’s work. You can also keep a master branch for the code that you know works and you want to keep. If working alone, you can make branches to try things out if you don’t know if they will work. GitHub can help keep track of these changes by letting other people know if you have changed anything, where the change occurred, and what you expect it will do. Git lets us know where the changes are. Using GitHub is helpful because it will store the master branch for you, and you can fork and clone other branches too.

<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

Body and head because you have to. Header and section I learned about and will try to use.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

From top to bottom. The browser displays elements in the order in which they appear.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned how to create a snippet. I probably won't create one until I am forced to because I get really set in my ways sometimes.
