How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

You can see the results of your work immediately, and also hone in on the css/html of specific elements.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

Height/width px and percentages.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Margin increases distance for the next element, border creates distance from the margin, and padding increases distance from the border.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

Love/hate, it was cool to learn something new, but at the same time it was a lot to take in and a lot of it was guess and check, where I didn't feel like I actually learned anything.
