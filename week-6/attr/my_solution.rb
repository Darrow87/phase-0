# Reflection
=begin
Release 1
1) The methods are setting age name and occupation
2) The are resetting the variables equal to something else

Release 2
1) We replaced the what is age method with the attr reader code.
2) what is age with attr reader
3) Yes

Release 3
1) We didn't need a full method to change the name
2) The method for changing the name, this time we just set it equal to something else when creating the instance
3) Yes

Release 6
1) A reader method allows you to access a variable outside of the class where it was defined
2) Writer methods allow you to change the value of a variable outside of the class
3) It allows you to simplify your code by just using a variable name for something as opposed to writing an entire method
4) No because it could make your code less secure
5) Visualsing how they work
